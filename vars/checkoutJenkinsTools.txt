Check out the jenkins-tools repo.

Normally we check out repos using our own `safe-git` scripts, but
those exist in the jenkins-tools repo so we can't use that script for
that repo.  This is the command that bootstraps checking out
jenkins-tools so we can then check out other repos.

It is not typically called manually -- onMaster/etc call it
automatically as needed.
