Same as `node("ka-test-ec2")` but does a bunch of executor-specific setup too.

1. It makes sure jenkins-tools is available in the current workspace
   (almost every node needs jenkins-tools to do further checkouts).
2. It enables virtualenv (for python scripts)
3. It enables access to secrets.py [optional]
4. It turns on timestamping of all commands run on that node.
