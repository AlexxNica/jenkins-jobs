Run the given string as a shell command, first making sure the pip
virtualenv is installed and active.

It uses build.lib's ensure_virtualenv to achieve this.

If you want any python process started by the shell command to have
access to secrets, you can set the <code>installSecrets</code>
parameter to true.

It is expected you will run this from the webapp directory (or some
other sibling directory to jenkins-tools).  If not, you should
set the <code>workspaceRoot</code> parameter to the workspace root
(that is, a directory that includes jenkins-tools as a subdir).
It can be a relative path, in which case it's taken relative to
the current directory when this command is executed.
