A fancier form of the build-in `timeout` step.

For one thing, it supports a nicer call syntax: you can use the normal
'20m', '1h', '1d' instead of having to use MINUTES, HOURS, and DAYS.

Second, it supports various timeout strategies, including "no
activity", which times out if nothing has been written to
stdout/stderr in the given time period.  You do this by setting
the timeout to 'output:20m'.  The default, if no strategy is
specified, is 'absolute:'.  TODO(csilvers): actually support this.
